# Stuffs Icons

A simple font which renders icons to your website. Sorta like Font Awesome but nowhere near as comprehensive.

I made this for my own personal projects using [icomoon](https://icomoon.com)

## Instructions

Open _index.html_ to see a list of all the glyphs in the font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in index.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied.

You won't need any of the files located under the _demo-files_ directory when including the generated font in your own projects.
